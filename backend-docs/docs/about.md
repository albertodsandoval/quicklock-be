# About QuickLock
QuickLock is a senior design project led by three seniors studying Computer Science at California State University, Northridge. 

## The Idea
QuickLock targets the insecure nature of physical locks by allowing you to control exactly who has access to your spaces at any given time. 

The issue with physical keys/locks is that they can be easily duplicated, lost, picked, and the list continues. Even when it comes to something as simple as having a dog sitter, it's hard to trust someone with the key to your home.

QuickLock is a mobile application that connects to a mechanical bolt that attaches to your door. As an owner of a QuickLock lock, you are able to grant keys to your lock to other users of our mobile app. They are then able to access your spaces by using their digital key to unlock your doors.

We also plan to develop a physical NFC keycard that an administrator can lend to others and deactivate at any time. 

## Timeline
The goal for this project is to have a fully functional MVP, which is better defined in our Jira docs, by **Spring 2026.**
